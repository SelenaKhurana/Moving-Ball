# Moving-Ball

MIT xPro project I created. It was an exercise to learn how to animate DOM elements and move them back and forth across the screen, detecting when they hit the edge of their bounding element and reversing direction/changing color.

Installation
Download the html file and run from your browser.

Usage
Reference for future similar projects

Roadmap
Change the background color of the containing element
Add more DOM elements
Stop DOM elements with a mouse click
